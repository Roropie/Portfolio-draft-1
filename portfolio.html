<h2> About me </h2>    
<p>Hello, I'm Rodeley Pierre, and welcome to my portfolio! With a lifelong passion for learning 
    and an unwavering desire to delve into coding languages, I am currently embarking on an exhilarating 
    journey to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all with the ultimate aim of becoming a skilled software engineer. 
    Over the past year, I had the incredible opportunity to explore the ServiceNow platform, which opened my eyes to its 
    immense potential. Recognizing the value of this technology, I leveraged my newfound skills to earn a System Administration certificate. 
    This accomplishment allowed me to secure a position with a forward-thinking organization specializing in HR Service Delivery and HR systems. Currently, 
    I am utilizing my expertise in system administration to contribute to the organization's success. My dedication to continuous learning and my unwavering 
    enthusiasm for coding drive me forward as I diligently work towards realizing my aspirations in the dynamic field of software engineering. Within this portfolio, 
    you'll find a showcase of my projects, skills, and achievements, highlighting my growth and commitment to excellence. Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey!
